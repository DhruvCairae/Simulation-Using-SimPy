# Simulation-Using-SimPy

A movie theatre has one ticket counter selling tickets for four movies (next show only).  A moviegoer tries to buy a number of tickets for a certain movie in a theater.  If the movie becomes sold out, he/she leaves the theatre.  If he/she gets to the counter , he/she tries to buy a number of tickets.  If not enough tickets are left, he/she argues with the ticket seller and leaves.
If at most one ticket is left after the moviegoer bought his/her tickets, the sold out event for this movie is triggered causing all remaining moviegoers for that movie to leave.
Toy Story, Mary Poppins, The Wizard of Oz and E.T ,Home Alone, Finding Nemo, Cars, Moana, and Minions are simulated as movie options for this model using  SimPy.
